Videos of the talks from PyCon 2015 can be found [here](http://pyvideo.org/category/65/pycon-us-2015). I haven't had a chance to watch any yet but I'm sure some of them will be excellent. You can see my favorite python and data science videos on the [recommended videos page](https://www.datasciencebytes.com/recommended-videos/).
