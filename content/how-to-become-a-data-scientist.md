A friend of mine recently asked me to share some of experiences in making the
transition from a biophysics Ph.D. student to data scientist. As I was writing
down some of the things I think were most helpful in making me a better
data scientist I realized there are probably a lot of people interested in 
making a similiar transition who could benefit from my experience.

## Goals

A year and a half before I finished my Ph.D. I starting thinking about
what exactly my plan for keeping a roof over my head after gradution
was. I had two main goals: To stay in the Bay Area and to never touch
another pipette again as long as I live. It was then I discovered that
data science was a thing, and I knew right away that it was the perfect
job for me. I also realized that if I wanted to get one of *the best,
most interesting* data science jobs I was going to have to put in a 
lot of time learning and practicing the trade. Below are the things 
that I found improved my skills the most.

## What to do

* Have a personal website (e.g. [frankcleary.com](http://www.frankcleary.com)).
I learned a lot about the internet and using remote linux machines by
building my personal website. It also helped give me motivation
to work on other projects because I had a place to share them. The site
started out as a personal learning project but now gets a steadily increasing
amount of traffic from web searches, mostly landing on pages where I've
posted tutorials. It's still only 10-15 users per day, but given that I
only got 10-15 users total in the first 6 months I had the site up that's not
bad.
