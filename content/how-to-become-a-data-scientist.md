A friend of mine recently asked me to share some of experiences in making the transition from a biophysics Ph.D. student to data scientist. As I was writing down some of the things I think were most helpful in making me a better data scientist I realized there are probably a lot of people interested in making a similiar transition who could benefit from my experience.

## Goals

A year and a half before I finished my Ph.D. I starting thinking about
what exactly my plan for keeping a roof over my head after gradution
was. I had two main goals: To stay in the Bay Area and to never touch
another pipette again as long as I live. It was then I discovered that
data science was a thing, and I knew right away that it was the perfect job for me. I also realized that if I wanted to get one of *the best, most interesting* data science jobs I was going to have to put in a lot of time learning and practicing the trade. Below are the things that I found improved my skills the most.

## Establish a data science portfolio

* Have a personal website (e.g. [frankcleary.com](http://www.frankcleary.com)).
I learned a lot about the internet and using remote linux machines by
building my personal website. It also helped give me motivation
to work on other projects because I had a place to share them. The site started out as a personal learning project but now gets a steadily increasing amount of traffic from web searches, mostly landing on pages where I've posted tutorials. It's still only 10-20 users per day, but given that I only got 10-20 users total in the first 6 months I had the site up that's not bad.

* Do data related projects in your spare time (and ideally post them on your website!). I've worked on a variety of fun personal side projects ranging from interactive D3.js interactive graphs to tutorials on matrix decomposition that made be a better programmer and a better data scientist. Having these projects on your website also gives you a portfolio that will make you stand out among other aspiring data scientists, it shows commitment to learning and (hopefully) skill.

## Study books and videos to learn more about computer science and data science

* Check out my [recommended books]({filename}/pages/recommended-books.md) page for the best books I've read.

* One of things I think is great about the open source software and data science communities is the extent to which talks from conferences and meetups are available for free online. Besides searching directly on [youtube](http://www.youtube.com), other sites like [pyvideo.org](http://www.pyvideo.org) have great video libraries. Take a look at my [recommened videos]({filename}/pages/recommended-videos.md) for some of my favorites.
