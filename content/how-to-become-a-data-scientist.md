A friend of mine recently asked me to share some of my experiences in making the transition from a biophysics Ph.D. student to data scientist. I realized there are probably a lot of people interested in making a similar transition who could benefit from my experience.

## Goals

A year and a half before I finished my Ph.D. I starting wondering what my plan for keeping a roof over my head after graduation was. I had two main goals: 


1. Stay in the Bay Area.
1. Never touch another pipette again as long as I live. 


It was at this time that I decided data science was where I would focus my future efforts. While many companies are hiring quantitative science Ph.D.s I realized that if I wanted one of **the best, most interesting** data science jobs I was going to have to put in a lot of time learning and practicing. Below are the things that I found improved my skills the most.

## Establish a data science portfolio

* Have a personal website (e.g. [frankcleary.com](http://www.frankcleary.com)).
I learned a lot about the internet and using remote linux machines by
building my personal website. It also helped give me motivation
to work on other projects because I had a place to share them. My site now gets 10-20 users per day from searches, mostly landing on pages where I've posted tutorials.

* Do data related projects in your spare time (and then post them on your website!). I've worked on a variety of fun side projects ranging from [interactive D3.js graphs](http://www.frankcleary.com/mpg) to [tutorials on matrix decomposition](http://www.frankcleary.com/svd) that made be a better programmer and a better data scientist. Having these projects on your website also gives you a portfolio that will help you stand out by showing commitment to learning and (hopefully) skill.

## Study books and videos to learn more about computer science and data science

* Check out my [recommended books](http://www.datasciencebytes.com/recommended-books) page for the best books I've read.

* Many great talks from conferences and meetups are available for free online. Besides searching directly on [youtube](http://www.youtube.com), other sites like [pyvideo.org](http://www.pyvideo.org) have great video libraries. Take a look at my [recommened videos](http://www.datasciencebytes.com//pages/recommended-videos.md) for some of my favorites.

* Take a free online class. I took [Introduction to Databases](https://class.stanford.edu/courses/Home/Databases/Engineering/about) with Prof. Jennifer Widom and [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/course/ml) with Prof. Andrew Ng. Both were engaging and cover essential knowledge for a data scientist that comes in handy when doing data science and when interviewing for data scientist jobs. Introduction to Databases was more polished and more rigorous.

## Do an internship

* A summer internship is a great way to get first hand experience doing data science in industry. I did one the summer before I graduated and it was a very valuable. Look into career fairs on campus (how I found mine), job posting websites and company websites directly for opportunities.<p></p>

## Learn to use [Git](http://git-scm.com) for version control

* [Git](http://git-scm.com) is great when writing software solo, and essential when working on team (which you will be in a job). The more you learn about Git the more efficient your code development process will be.

* Create an account on [GitHub](https://github.com) and post your portfolio projects to it. Link to the account on your resume to make sure your projects are visible.
