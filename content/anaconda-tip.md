Installing all the python libraries required for data science can be a challenge, especially on windows machine. Unfortunately the same thing that makes the libraries fast also makes them difficult to distribute to different system types. Luckily there are a few free options for getting up and running painlessly. I recommend installing [Anaconda](http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install.html), an easy to install python distribution that includes all the essential libraries like NumPy, SciPy, pandas and IPython. An alternative is [Enthought Canopy](https://store.enthought.com/downloads/).
