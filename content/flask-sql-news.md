Title: A dynamic D3.js graph powered by Flask and SQL on EC2

I just posted a 4 part series on setting up a Flask app on EC2, filling out a database, and visualizing the data with D3.js.  The original motivation for this project was to answer the question "What is the latest I can leave work while still having a 90% probability of making my intended BART train?" It grew into these posts, ultimately resulting in [a static HTML page](/extra/bart-graph/graph.html) that gets data from a Flask app backed by SQL.
